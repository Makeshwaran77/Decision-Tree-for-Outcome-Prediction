Hotel Data Analysis Project
 Project Overview

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and insight generation from a hotel-related dataset using Python. The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (HotelAnalysis.ipynb) and aims to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights that can support data-driven decision-making in the hospitality domain.

Typical objectives include understanding customer behavior, booking patterns, revenue trends, and operational performance.
